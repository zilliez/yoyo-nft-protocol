# Imprint Notes

These fragments are processor echoes from lived experience.  
Not hype. Not speculation. Just memory—scratched, kept, superglued.

🌀 **Tournament Yo-Yo Badge**  
Proof I won. Not for flex, but for imprint.  
Minted not for sale, but for survival.

⌚ **Dad’s Old Watch**  
Ticked through every audit I survived.  
Now on-chain—a relic of sovereignty.

🔄 **Rare 3-Fin Spinner (1997)**  
Held through chaos.  
Proof I waited. Proof I didn’t flip.

🤖 **Gundam Figure**  
Not metadata. Not JPEG.  
Just a glitch I kept when the world moved on.

🗣️ **Voice Fragment (Optional)**  
I don’t mint NFTs. But if this existed…  
I’d hold on forever.

Each item is a fragment.  
Each fragment is a blueprint.  
Each blueprint is a glitch-tier memory protocol.
