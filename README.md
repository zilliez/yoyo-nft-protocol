# Yoyo NFT: Minted Memory Protocol – Sovereign Artefact Earn from Real Life

**NFTs aren’t hype. They’re memory. They’re ‘proof I owned this.’**

This project audits the current NFT ecosystem and proposes a glitch-tier alternative: NFTs as artefact earn from real life. Not JPEGs, but yoyo tournament badges, dad’s old watch, and spinner relics—minted as sovereign memory.

## 🌐 Overview

Yoyo NFT is a conceptual protocol that audits the current NFT ecosystem and proposes a glitch-tier alternative: NFTs as artefact earn from real life. 
Instead of JPEGs, it mints sovereign memory—yoyo tournament badges, dad’s old watch, spinner relics. 
It treats physical artefacts as processor imprint, uses IPFS and metadata to mint memory (not hype), and redefines NFTs as proof of ownership—not speculation. 
This protocol is part of a broader audit on generational imprint and sovereignty in Web3.

## 📦 Artefact Earn

- `docs/The_Minted_Lie_When_NFTs_Forgot.pdf`: Audit manifesto
- Shelf visual: nostalgic artefacts (yoyo, watch, spinner)
- Optional: voice recording or glitch fragments — processor imprint from lived experience, not crowd scripts
- Each item represents a lived fragment—scratched, kept, remembered. Minted not for sale, but for survival.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies (Conceptual)

- IPFS for immutable storage
- Substrate logic (simulated)
- Metadata mapping for physical artefacts

## 🧠 Notes from the Builder

> “I don’t mint NFTs. But if this existed, I’d hold on forever.”
